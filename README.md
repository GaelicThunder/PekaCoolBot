Hi, i'm Peka, i can learn from people's messages and chat like them.
If you want me to generate a message, you can mention me, say my nickname or reply to any of my messages
If you want to play with the HentaiCardGame, then let me explain how it works:
- You start with 7 PekaPoints, this are the points you need to buy the cards
- You get points with CardQuiz or whenever Peka answer at your message randomly
- This cards are yours only, they can't be copied by other people
- Those cards comes in form of sticker that you can see only calling the bot, and they have their stats (Number of Tags, Tags, Page numbers and sauce number)
- Send a card to see the sauce 'wink wink'
- To see your cards just tag @PekaCoolBot and press [space]
- Before using Peka for this game, you have to start talking with her privatly and do /start
- In Groups, Peka needs to be an Admin to have full access to her functionality and being able to delete messages (this is only needed for a command)
List of commands:

##### Peka.py:
-This version does not store triggers, it stores messages and tries to generate sentences.

Code is super messy, i putted her on a Pimoroni GFX Hat and Raspberry Pi Zero.
Usually, a clock is displayed, but everytime a sentence is generated it get shown on her screen.
